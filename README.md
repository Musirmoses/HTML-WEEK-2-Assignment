# 📚 README - WEEK 2: Enhanced HTML Elements 🎉

## 🌟 What’s This All About?  
This webpage shows a bunch of cool stuff you can do with HTML—the language behind all the websites you love! You’ll see lists, pictures, videos, sounds, tables, and even a form where people can type in their info. It’s like a little demo playground for web elements! 🕹️

## 👀 What You’ll Find on the Page

### 1. 📖 Definition Lists  
- A neat list that explains some common web terms.  
- Each word like **HTML** is followed by what it means, e.g., *HyperText Markup Language*.  
- Perfect for boosting your web vocabulary! 📚

### 2. 🍎 Nested Lists (Lists Inside Lists!)  
- Lists that have smaller lists inside them—like a listception!  
- For example, under "Fruits," you get the main fruits and even a mini-list of Apple types: Red Apple, Green Apple 🍏🍎  
- Uses bullets (- ) and numbers (1, 2, 3 or a, b, c) for fun variety.

### 3. 🖼️ Images  
- Shows some cool pictures: live streaming setup and a scholarship snapshot.  
- Sized just right so everything looks nice. 📸

### 4. 🎥 Videos  
- Watch a video right on the page!  
- Has play/pause and other controls. ▶️⏸️  
- If your browser says “nope,” it kindly tells you it can’t play it.

### 5. 🎵 Audio  
- Press play and listen to an audio file! 🎧  
- If audio isn’t your browser’s thing, you’ll get a friendly heads-up.

### 6. 📊 Tables  
- A tidy table shows items, prices, and quantities for fruits and veggies.  
- Great for organizing info clearly like a pro. 🥕🍒

### 7. 📝 Registration Form  
- A simple form to fill out your details:  
  - Your Name (at least 3 letters ✍️)  
  - Email (to keep in touch 📧)  
  - Upload a profile picture (say cheese! 📷)  
  - Write a short bio (tell your story 📖)  
  - Pick your country from a dropdown 🌎  
- Click “Submit” and your info sends off (once set up on a website).

### 8. 📅 Footer  
- Shows who owns the page and the year — copyright info.  
- Keeps everything official! © 2025 Moses Odhiambo

## 🛠️ Extra Info  
- This page is written in **HTML**, the building blocks of websites.  
- Works on all browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge. 🌐  
- Make sure your pictures, videos, and audio are saved in the same folder as this file to see everything working.  
- The form won’t actually send info unless you connect it to a web server — it’s just the front part!  

## 🎯 Why Bother?  
This cool example helps you understand how different parts of a website come alive — from lists and media to tables and forms. It’s a fun way to peek behind the curtain of web design! 🎭
